Leaving hometown and starting life in a different country with different language, different law and different cultural expectations need a period to adjust. For those refugees and asylum seekers who suffer this process will feel more difficult due to the circumstances under which they leave their home country. For instance, some of them can not apply an valid refugee visa and find supporting organisation due to language and communication barriers. Some of them got ongoing mental health issues due to trauma. In order to help them,this application empowers refugees and asylum seekers to locate and contact various non-government organisation in Australia by multilingual. People who has been survived also can share their experience on this platform which help energise and inspire others.

### How Our Idea is Different From/Improves Others
Despite the function of ARAS Community is quite similar with some travel app (TripAdviser, googleMap), it still different from them. They focus on the different groups of users. In addition, compare with other refugee aid app. ARAS create an online social platform allows users sharing their stories and feelings.
