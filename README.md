## Summary 
Leaving their hometown and starting a life in a different country with a different language, different laws, and different cultural expectations requires a period of adjustment. For those refugees and asylum seekers who suffer from this process, it will feel more difficult due to the circumstances under which they are leaving their home country. Some of them can’t apply for a valid refugee visa or find supporting organizations due to the language and communication barriers. Some of them also have ongoing mental health issues due to trauma.

For that, our solution and method to address this issue was by providing a web based platform, Path. Path empowers the refugees and asylum seekers to locate and contact the various organizations in Australia by translating the information into their own language. People who have survived are also able to share their experiences on this platform, which helps energies and inspire others. For the other hand, it also provides a platform for people who want to help refugee and asylum seekers. People can be connected in a personal way. Choose if you can offer help, such as form filling, language help or guiding. The platform creates a personal match and brings people into contact with each other. 

The site's features include allowing non-English users to choose from four different languages, so the site will translate the language they choose. And let them understand how to use the site. Next, the user can choose the service according to their own requirements. Including looking for people to help them, looking for supporting organizations, and be a person to help others. 
For refugee users, the main purpose of their coming to our website is generally to seek for help. "Find helps" this feature allows them to according to their own needs to find a helper. And contact them through our website. In order to solve the privacy issue, the path website has a registration function. And cancel the display of personal contact in the personal profile, the user can only communicate on our platform. And then they may exchange contact to form a long-term help mode after.
