## Project: Australia Refugee and Asylum Seekers (ARAS) Community 
## Introduction:
Australia Refugee and Asylum Seekers (ARAS) Community is a mobile based application provides an online social community that makes connections between refugees and aid organisations. It also creates an solution for refugees and asylum seekers who have language and communication barriers to locate and contact different types of supporting community in Australia.

## Concept:
### Background
The seriousness and complexity of the problems caused by global asylum-seekers and refugee flows pose a significant challenge to the countries of the world's destinations, including Australia.
(linking sentence)
Leaving hometown and starting life in a different country with different language, different law and different cultural expectations need a period to adjust. For those refugees and asylum seekers who suffer this process will feel more difficult due to the circumstances under which they leave their home country. For instance, some of them can not apply an valid refugee visa and find supporting organisation due to language and communication barriers. Some of them got ongoing mental health issues due to trauma. In order to help them,this application empowers refugees and asylum seekers to locate and contact various non-government organisation in Australia by multilingual. People who has been survived also can share their experience on this platform which help energise and inspire others. 
### Purpose
Assisting those who need help to settle / to start a new life in Australia, especially refugees and asylum seekers.
(The project intended to help refugees and asylum seekers in adapting to changes and in dealing with complex environment in a positive way. This means it mainly forces on 1)helping people seek legitimate supporting and 2)allow people sharing story of being resettled with others.)
### Audience

### How Our Idea is Different From/Improves Others
Despite the function of ARAS Community is quite similar with some travel app (TripAdviser, googleMap), it still different from them. They focus on the different groups of users. In addition, compare with other refugee aid app. ARAS create an online social platform allows users sharing their stories and feelings.
