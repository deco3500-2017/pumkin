### Week8 Stand-Up Documentation 

In this week we had done great progresses in the project. Overall, our key activity was conducting research, including gaining secondary information from literature review, analyzing data from the governmental database, and collecting information through qualitative approaches. 

In details, we had got connected with a non-for-profit organization that supports refugees and asylum people in Australia. With the organization’s help, we were able to finish the interviews and the basic user testing. In addition, based on the qualitative research, we had established the persona during the design and developed the drafts of logo design and application prototype.

Generally, the key findings from the academic research are:
•	Most of the refugees and asylum peoples in Australia are from Iraq, Sudan and Syria; and
•	Most of the refugees’ and asylum peoples’ first language are not English

Additionally, the key findings from the primary data are:
•	Most of the refugees and asylum peoples can skillfully use computers and use their mobile phones to get access to the Internet, especially among the young groups of the refugees and asylum peoples; 
•	The most wanted supports when they are boarding to Australia are English support, accommodation support and the gaining of valid certificates, such like SHEV and TPV;
•	Most of them do not have jobs, thus their livings are greatly depending on the supports provided by Centerlink;
•	The support givers’ most favorable assistances including: language support, loving and social support (how to take the bus/ how to go shopping), and daily necessities support;
•	The motivations of the support givers to provide assistance to the refugees and the asylum peoples are basically three, which are: developing their social networks to know more people with the same motivations; taking more social responsibilities to contribute to the community; and simply wanting to do some meaningful activities during the spare time.

At last, during the user testing process, the volunteers provide several suggestions for us to develop the application, which are:
•	Providing more language versions in the application, containing English and several other options of their own mother languages;
•	The end using platform of the application should be website, thus the users can quickly get adjusted to the application and make the use;
•	When going through the sign up process, the personal information should not contain the identity options of refugee, asylum seeker or helper, because their identities would be changed during the time. Thus, the current refugees and the asylum seekers could be the future helpers through the time; and
•	The final name of the website is “Path”, because this option can provide more perspectives than the original name “Australia Refugee and Asylum Seeker Community (ASAR)”. Although ASAR gives a more direct understanding about the website, Path contains more elements of adjustment and experiences during the process.

Based on the achievements made in this week, the milestones before nest stand up are:
•	Conducting a user testing with the modified prototype. (For this time, the aim of the user testing is to examine if the UI design can make clear sense to the target users; and if the functions of the website have achieved the expectations of the target users);
•	Based on the user testing, the interactive function of the prototyping will be conducted (to test the task flow); and
•	Starting the design of demonstration
