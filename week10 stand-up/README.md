### Week10 Stand-Up Documentation 

This week, our team have finished two user testing. The purposes of the two user testing are the same, which is to test if the users could fully understand our product and make an easy use of the key functions (connecting refugees and ensure a helper-matching process). The first feedback is from Mockup 1. However, due to the lack of comprehensiveness of the prototype, most of the participants were not able to understand how to achieve the information about finding the helpers. Thus, in order to overcome this issue, we developed an interactive and high quality online prototype with the use of Wix for further feedbacks. Therefore, from this prototype, we have gained several suggestions about the features of the website. 
#### The key suggestions are:
- For the refugees, the signup time should be minimized;
- The target users could help us to do the translations of the websites (Add an additional page with forms, and allow the target users to translate the texts information and buttons to translated into their own languages, and then submit their translations to the other helpers for auditing);
- Adding some instruction related information about the use of the online website (this suggestion is similar to the one explained below, which can be collaborated); and
- Generating more attractive functions for the target audiences to get interested to use the website (for example, adding a storyboard to tell the audiences about the stories of developing process of the website).
#### Therefore, based on the suggestions, for the following process, the key changes are:
- To simplify the signup process for the refugees by requiring less information about the personal profile. However, as we still needing some necessary information (such like their first languages, needs, locations, cultures and religious) in order to match the most appropriate helpers, some information still need to be collected. The resolution is to make this process in the “Helping Finding” function;
- Due to the technological limitation, currently we will only have four language versions of this website (the four languages will be spoken by the most refugees in Australia);
- In the find helper function, every step will be supported by the instruction information, in order to make the users easier to understand the use of the website.
#### Additionally, the feedbacks in stand-up are:
- Although the purposes and the processes of the two prototypes were the same, because of the qualities of the designs, we decided to collaborate the two designs. And the layout of the website will be based on the first mockup;
- We would not use Wix to develop the website, but we decided to use GitHub to develop the website in order to make more interaction;
- By attending the lecture on Tuesday that was about the information of privacy, we had gained lots of valuable knowledge for the information gathering process during the web developing process;
- The feedbacks from the tutor about the interview issues during user testing was that: we could use nonverbal communication during the process, by encouraging them to use writing instead of speaking.
#### At last, the following things to do are:
- To get connected with the designer to modify the website design based on the new feedbacks;
- To develop the website on GitHub by starting coding;
- To start the design of the storyboard in order to make the target users understand how our website works and how to use our website; and 
- For the advertising process, as our target customers are refugees and people who seek asylum
