### Week12 Stand-Up Documentation 

In this week, we made several modifications based on the feedbacks gained from the last user testing process. Based on the lecture on Tuesday, Dr.Mark Burdon indicated the privacy issue during the data collecting process. 
##### As there are indeed several connections with our design, we found several problems in our website about the data collection process:
- Our product needs to collect personal information; 
- Dr.Mark Burdon gave us an overview about the personal information; and 
- The information about individual identification. In particularly, an individual is a person who can be identified by two elements, which are identified and reasonable identifiable.

For the personal information collection, we missed notification of the collection of personal information. Therefore, we need to add this step into the online product. The reasons for this are to notify our users about why we need this personal information and how we would use this information during the services. 

In addition, we need to add a personal account page in our website in order for the users to access, correct and update their personal information. 

However, because we did not make a consistent concept at the beginning of the project, the programmer(Huy) in the team started to develop the codes (demonstration ?). After gaining the suggestions from the tutor, we decided to develop our website based on YiuChun’s design. Before the stand-up, the key function of the website is to “get connected between the refugees and the helpers”.

Currently, the key pages of the website are: home page, service page, about page and user page. On the home page, some attractive pictures will be used to make the target audiences get interested in signing up and using the website. The functions of the service page re to help the refugees to find the appropriate helpers, and to help the refugees to find the organizations based on their particular needs. (MVP)

The following things are to:
- Conduct another user testing with the finalized website in order to ensure the accomplishment of MVP;
- Prepare for the promotional materials, such like posters and brochures;
