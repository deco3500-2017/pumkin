### Project Proposal
### Prepared by: Team Pumpkin 
## Project: Australia Refugee and Asylum Seekers (ARAS) Community 
## Introduction:
Australia Refugee and Asylum Seekers (ARAS) Community is a mobile based application provides an online social community that makes connections between refugees and aid organisations. The situation this project addressed is refugees and asylum seekers may find themselves in a dilemma in their countries of asylum. Therefore, ARAS also creates an solution for refugees and asylum seekers who have language and communication barriers to locate and contact different types of supporting community in Australia. 

## Concept:
### Background
The seriousness and complexity of the problems that are caused by the global asylum-seekers and refugee flow poses a significant challenge to the countries that are seen as the destinations, including Australia. Based on the Australian government’s statistics, the number of refugees and asylum seekers that Australia accepts has increased in recent years. As of 2015-2016, Australia accepted around 17,000 total refugees (Refugee Council of Australia, 2017).

Leaving their hometown and starting a life in a different country with a different language, different laws and different cultural expectations requires a period of adjustment. For those refugees and asylum seekers who suffer of this process, it will feel more difficult due to the circumstances under which they are leaving their home country. Some of them can’t apply for a valid refugee visa or find supporting organisations due to the language and communication barriers. Some of them also have ongoing mental health issues due to trauma. 

For that, in order to make things easier, this platform empowers the refugees and asylum seekers to locate and contact the various organisations in Australia by translating the information into their own language. People who have survived are also able to share their experiences on this platform, which helps energies and inspire others. For the other hand, it also provides a platform for people who want to help refugee and asylum seekers. People can be connected in a personal way. Choose if you can offer help, such as form filling, language help or guiding. The platform creates a personal match and brings people into contact to each other. In order to allow more people to use this platform, we will identify our platform form by analyzing the results of our survey.
### Goals
Assisting those who need help to settle / to start a new life in Australia, especially refugees and asylum seekers. 
### Audience
- Refugees / Asylum seekers who 
	- are happy to share their experience in Australia
	- willing to talk to others
	- searching for locations of organisations
	- need help for applying visas
	- need translation support
- People who are here to help the others 	
### How Our Idea is Different From/Improves Others
Despite the fact that the function of the ARAS Community is quite similar with some travel apps, such as TripAdviser and googleMap, it is still different from them. They focus on different groups of users. In addition, compared with other refugee aid apps, ARAS creates an online social platform that allows users interact with orhers.
